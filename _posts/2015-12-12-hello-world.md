  Howdy! This is my first post, so I'll go ahead and get the introduction out of the way.
</div>

My name is Cameron Alexander (sometimes Camorn Axelander, EmptyFlash, or SoftwareWarlock). I'm a software developer for a start-up in Houston, Texas.

We've worked on many projects using a variety of technologies. My current favorite is Django + Django REST Framework, so don't be surprised if they're the subject of a few post in the coming weeks.

I've been programming for about 7 years now (professionally for around 2). I stared in ActionScript making Flash games for fun. Java was my first love, but currently Python and Scala are tied for the title of My Favorite Programming Language.

I'm also a recent vim neophyte (about 5 months now), and I can safely say I'm never going back. Check out my [dotfiles](https://github.com/SoftwareWarlock/dotfiles).

In the recent months, I've realized I don't have a decent outlet for the thoughts that I have about software development. I tried to express my ideas through twitter ([@SoftwareWarlock](https://twitter.com/SoftwareWarlock)), but 140 characters is very limiting. So that's what this blog is for, a place to express my ideas, maybe post some solutions to problems that I others would find useful.

If you'd like to contact me about anything (questions, concerns, hopes, dreams), [twitter](https://twitter.com/SoftwareWarlock) would be the best place. Otherwise, [email](mailto:emptyflash@gmail.com) is sufficient (though my response time may be subpar).
