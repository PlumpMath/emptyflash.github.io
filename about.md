  Hey there! Welcome to Software Warlock, a blog about software development, programming, and wizardry.
</p>

My name is Cameron Alexander (sometimes Camorn Axelander, EmptyFlash, or SoftwareWarlock). Iâ€™m a software developer for a start-up in Houston, Texas.

I've been programming for about 7 years now (professionally for around 2). I stared in ActionScript making Flash games for fun. Java was my first love, but currently Python and Scala are tied for the title of My Favorite Programming Language&trade;.

I needed a place to express some of my thoughts, ideas, analyses, as well as a space to share solutions to problems I think the world needs to know.

If you'd like to contact me about anything (questions, concerns, hopes, dreams), [twitter](https://twitter.com/SoftwareWarlock) would be the best place. Otherwise, [email](mailto:emptyflash@gmail.com) is sufficient (though my response time may be subpar).
